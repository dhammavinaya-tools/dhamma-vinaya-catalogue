Object - anything belonging to a human being or a group of them.  2. Perception - one percieves that it belongs to someone else.  3. Intention - one decides to steal it.  4. Effort - one makes some kind of effort to take it.  5. Value - the object's value should be more than five màsakas	Only if the owner abandons all sense of ownership would it genuinely count as abandoned. A bhikkhu can commit an offense not only if he himself steals an object, but also if he incites another to steal. Group of bhikkhus steal valuables worth collectively more than five māsakas but which when divided among them yield shares worth less than five māsakas each, all incur a pārājika. A bhikkhu who takes things from the Community’s common stores, assuming he has the right to help himself, commits no offense even if the assumption proves false. A wise policy when one is in doubt about an item’s ownership would be not to take the item for one’s own, or at most to take it on loan. When a bhikkhu steals an item worth 1/24 troy ounce of gold or more, is full offense. When the item is of lesser value, there will be doubt—and when concerning a pārājika, the tradition of the Vinaya consistently gives the bhikkhu the benefit of the doubt. Special cases from commentaries: Smuggling: A bhikkhu carrying items subject to an import duty hides them as he goes through customs. Destruction of property False dealing: A bhikkhu makes counterfeit money or uses counterfeit weights. Shifting a boundary marker.

Now, if a king or a kings’ official or a brahmin or a male householder should convey by messenger a robe-fund for a bhikkhu [saying]: “Having traded this robe-fund for a robe,clothe the bhikkhu named so and so with a robe,” and if that messenger, having approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, this robe-fund has been brought for the venerable one. Let the venerable one accept the robefund!” [then] that messenger should be spoken to thus by that bhikkhu: “Friend, we do not accept a robe-fund, but we do accept a robe at the right time [when it is] allowable.” If that messenger should say thus to that bhikkhu: “Is there, perhaps, someone who provides services for the venerable one?” [then,] bhikkhus, by a bhikkhu who is in need of a robe, a service provider can be pointed out: a monastery attendant or a male layfollower [saying]: “Sir, this is the bhikkhus’ service provider.” If that messenger having instructed that service provider, having approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, the service provider whom the venerable one has pointed out hass been instructed by me. Let the venerable one approach [him] at the right time [and] he will clothe you with a robe,” [then] bhikkhus, having approached the service provider, [the service provider] can be prompted [and] can be reminded two or three times by the bhikkhu who is in need of a robe [saying]: “Friend, I am in need of a robe.” [If through] prompting [and] reminding [him] two or three times, he should have [him] bring forth that robe, it is good. If he should not have [him] bring [it] forth, [then] four times, five times, six times at the mosti [it] can be stood [for] by [a bhikkhu] who has become silent. [If through] standing silently for [it] four times, five times, six times at the mosti he should have [him] bring forth that robei it is good; if [through] making effort more than thati he should have [him] produce that robei [this is a case] involving relinquishment and confession.  If he should not have [him] produce [it]i [then] from wherever the robe-fund may have been brought, there [he] himself can goi or a messenger can be sent [saying]: “Sirs, that robe-fund which you sent for the bhikkhu does not fulfil any need of that bhikkhu. Let the sirs endeavour for [what is their] own. Do not lose what is your own.” This is the proper procedure here	in stating three times, in standing six times; in stating less than three times, in standing less than six times; if himself not stating, he gives; if stating, the owners give; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer	1) Object: a fund for the purchase of robe-cloth left with a steward. This factor to cover any fund set aside for one's own requisites. 2) Effort: One makes an excessive number of promptings. A  dukkaṭa for the excessive promptings 3) Result: One obtains the requested requisite.	The purpose of the protocols is to free bhikkhus from the even more bothersome worries and complexities that come with participating in buying, selling, and monetary matters in general. If a bhikkhu follows the protocols recommended here, the money placed with the steward still belongs to the donor, and the responsibility for making a fair trade lies with the steward.   Important that he not abuse the steward's services.  One may say only, "I need a robe (or whatever the requisite may be), Not "Give me a robe," "Get me a robe," "Buy me a robe.   To apply the protocols  where the steward is indicated by the bhikkhu, by the donor, or by neither .   For Sangha an acceptable phrased "This is for the purpose of the four requisites," or "Accept whatever is allowable coming from this," without mentioning the Saṅgha or any bhikkhu. But not "I'm giving this to the Saṅgha," for whatever the purpose, the gift may not be accepted. For donation boxes "The donation box is over there," but not, "Put it there."  If checking account is set up for impersonal purposes such as the construction and upkeep of monastery buildings, a bhikkhu may not sign a check drawing on the account. A fund has been set up for a particular requisite, it should as a general principle be used to buy only that requisite.

If he does not, he commits an offense entailing confession	if he is not admonished; if he gives it up; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer	Simply holding such a view is not enough to bring a bhikkhu under the purview of this rule, but if he asserts it to others, the Vibhaṅga states that other bhikkhus have the duty of reprimanding him up to three times in the manner described in the rule. If, having learned of his assertion, they do not reprimand him, they each incur a dukkaṭa, for if he goes unreprimanded, he may continue with his assertions as he likes without incurring a penalty. A Community preparing to impose this rule on a stubborn bhikkhu should also be prepared to impose a suspension transaction on him immediately in case he refuses to respond to the formal rebuke.	If, after being reprimanded, he relinquishes his view, he incurs no penalty. But if he doesn’t, he incurs a dukkaṭa. He should then be taken into the midst of the Community to be admonished and rebuked as described under Sg 10, the only difference here being that the penalty is a dukkaṭa in each of the preliminary stages, and a pācittiya after the third formal rebuke. (The formula for the rebuke is given in Appendix VIII BMC 1) If a bhikkhu penalized under this rule persists in asserting his evil view, he is subject to an act of suspension, under which he is not allowed to commune or affiliate with bhikkhus in any Community until he sees the error of his ways and relinquishes his view (see BMC2, Chapter 20	Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. An evil viewpoint of this sort has arisen in Bhikkhu (name): “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive, when engaged in are not genuine obstructions.” He does not relinquish that view. If the Community is ready, it should rebuke Bhikkhu (name) for the sake of relinquishing that view. This is the motion. 3 times Bhikkhu (name) has been rebuked by the Community for the sake of relinquishing that view. This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.

Value - the object's value should be more than five màsakas	Only if the owner abandons all sense of ownership would it genuinely count as abandoned. A bhikkhu can commit an offense not only if he himself steals an object, but also if he incites another to steal. Group of bhikkhus steal valuables worth collectively more than five māsakas but which when divided among them yield shares worth less than five māsakas each, all incur a pārājika. A bhikkhu who takes things from the Community’s common stores, assuming he has the right to help himself, commits no offense even if the assumption proves false. A wise policy when one is in doubt about an item’s ownership would be not to take the item for one’s own, or at most to take it on loan. When a bhikkhu steals an item worth 1/24 troy ounce of gold or more, is full offense. When the item is of lesser value, there will be doubt—and when concerning a pārājika, the tradition of the Vinaya consistently gives the bhikkhu the benefit of the doubt.

Now, if a king or a kings’ official or a brahmin or a male householder should convey by messenger a robe-fund for a bhikkhu [saying]: “Having traded this robe-fund for a robe,clothe the bhikkhu named so and so with a robe,” and if that messenger, having approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, this robe-fund has been brought for the venerable one. Let the venerable one accept the robefund!” [then] that messenger should be spoken to thus by that bhikkhu: “Friend, we do not accept a robe-fund, but we do accept a robe at the right time [when it is] allowable.” If that messenger should say thus to that bhikkhu: “Is there, perhaps, someone who provides services for the venerable one?” [then,] bhikkhus, by a bhikkhu who is in need of a robe, a service provider can be pointed out: a monastery attendant or a male layfollower [saying]: “Sir, this is the bhikkhus’ service provider.” If that messenger having instructed that service provider, having approached that bhikkhu, should say so: “Venerable Sir, the service provider whom the venerable one has pointed out hass been instructed by me. Let the venerable one approach [him] at the right time [and] he will clothe you with a robe,” [then] bhikkhus, having approached the service provider, [the service provider] can be prompted [and] can be reminded two or three times by the bhikkhu who is in need of a robe [saying]: “Friend, I am in need of a robe.” [If through] prompting [and] reminding [him] two or three times, he should have [him] bring forth that robe, it is good. If he should not have [him] bring [it] forth, [then] four times, five times, six times at the mosti [it] can be stood [for] by [a bhikkhu] who has become silent. [If through] standing silently for [it] four times, five times, six times at the mosti he should have [him] bring forth that robei it is good; if [through] making effort more than thati he should have [him] produce that robei [this is a case] involving relinquishment and confession.

Do not lose what is your own.” This is the proper procedure here	in stating three times, in standing six times; in stating less than three times, in standing less than six times; if himself not stating, he gives; if stating, the owners give; if he is mad, if he is the first wrong-doer	1) Object: a fund for the purchase of robe-cloth left with a steward. This factor to cover any fund set aside for one's own requisites. 2) Effort: One makes an excessive number of promptings. A  dukkaṭa for the excessive promptings 3) Result: One obtains the requested requisite.	The purpose of the protocols is to free bhikkhus from the even more bothersome worries and complexities that come with participating in buying, selling, and monetary matters in general. If a bhikkhu follows the protocols recommended here, the money placed with the steward still belongs to the donor, and the responsibility for making a fair trade lies with the steward.   Important that he not abuse the steward's services.  One may say only, "I need a robe (or whatever the requisite may be), Not "Give me a robe," "Get me a robe," "Buy me a robe.   To apply the protocols  where the steward is indicated by the bhikkhu, by the donor, or by neither .   For Sangha an acceptable phrased "This is for the purpose of the four requisites," or "Accept whatever is allowable coming from this," without mentioning the Saṅgha or any bhikkhu. But not "I'm giving this to the Saṅgha," for whatever the purpose, the gift may not be accepted. For donation boxes "The donation box is over there," but not, "Put it there."  If checking account is set up for impersonal purposes such as the construction and upkeep of monastery buildings, a bhikkhu may not sign a check drawing on the account. A fund has been set up for a particular requisite, it should as a general principle be used to buy only that requisite.

The Buddha would never say such a thing.

If, having learned of his assertion, they do not reprimand him, they each incur a dukkaṭa, for if he goes unreprimanded, he may continue with his assertions as he likes without incurring a penalty. A Community preparing to impose this rule on a stubborn bhikkhu should also be prepared to impose a suspension transaction on him immediately in case he refuses to respond to the formal rebuke.	If, after being reprimanded, he relinquishes his view, he incurs no penalty. But if he doesn’t, he incurs a dukkaṭa. He should then be taken into the midst of the Community to be admonished and rebuked as described under Sg 10, the only difference here being that the penalty is a dukkaṭa in each of the preliminary stages, and a pācittiya after the third formal rebuke. (The formula for the rebuke is given in Appendix VIII BMC 1) If a bhikkhu penalized under this rule persists in asserting his evil view, he is subject to an act of suspension, under which he is not allowed to commune or affiliate with bhikkhus in any Community until he sees the error of his ways and relinquishes his view (see BMC2, Chapter 20	Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. An evil viewpoint of this sort has arisen in Bhikkhu (name): “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive, when engaged in are not genuine obstructions.” He does not relinquish that view. If the Community is ready, it should rebuke Bhikkhu (name) for the sake of relinquishing that view.
