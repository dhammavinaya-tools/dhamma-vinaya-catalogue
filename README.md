# dhamma-vinaya-catalogue
A structured, data-ready catalogue of early Buddhist suttas, Vinaya rules, and Khandhaka sections.
Its aim is to support teachers, practitioners, and researchers with a structured, extensible map of the early Buddhist texts.

Inside you’ll find three master “Edit” sheets:

- **Suttas Edit** – one row per sutta with nikaya and chapter info, titles, themes, topics, summaries, key excerpts, and parallels.
- **Patimokkha Edit** – one row per rule with codes, short explanations, themes, severity, and references.
- **KD Edit** – one row per Khandhaka section with themes, summaries, and key rules/allowances.
